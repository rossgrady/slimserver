# slimserver
Server for Logitech Squeezebox players. This server is also called Logitech Media Server

This fork makes changes necessary to support MySQL 5.7.x as the database backend.

Note that DBD::mysql no longer ships with slimserver, so you'll need to add it, either to your perl module path, or to /CPAN/DBD

(I haven't uploaded it here)
